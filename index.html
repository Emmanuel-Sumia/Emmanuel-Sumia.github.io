            <h6>CyberSecurity and AI</h6>
            <div class="pra">
                <p>In technology i aspire to focus on CyberSecurity and Artificial Intelligence, as well as want to have an understanding on what happens with development(Both Web and Mobile). 
                    This is because the interconnectedness of technology means that a breach or vulnerability in one system can impact other systems and devices. Cybersecurity and AI can help identify and address these vulnerabilities before they can be exploited by attackers.
                    And Importantly, AI can be used to enhance cybersecurity by improving threat detection, automating security processes, and identifying anomalies in network traffic or user behavior. By combining cybersecurity and AI, professionals can develop innovative solutions to address emerging threats.</p>
