                <h2>About Me</h2>    
                <p>Hello, this is Emmanuel John Sumia and I am a 22-year-old Computer Science student at Minnesota State University, Mankato in Minnesota, United States. 
                    I am originally from Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. I am a passionate, enthusiastic and creative individual who always seeks to learn and grow. <br></p>
                <P>
                I believe that I can make a difference in my community by utilizing the opportunities available in different fields and helping bridge the gap while raising the standard of living for people. 
                I am driven by the purpose of serving others and making a positive impact in my community.I am interested in the intersection of technology and business and hope to use my education to make a difference in the world.
                <P>
                In technology i aspire to focus on CyberSecurity and Artificial Intelligence, as well as want to have an understanding on what happens with development(Both Web and Mobile). 
                This is because the interconnectedness of technology means that a breach or vulnerability in one system can impact other systems and devices. Cybersecurity and AI can help identify and address these vulnerabilities before they can be exploited by attackers.
                And Importantly, AI can be used to enhance cybersecurity by improving threat detection, automating security processes, and identifying anomalies in network traffic or user behavior. By combining cybersecurity and AI, professionals can develop innovative solutions to address emerging threats.</P>
